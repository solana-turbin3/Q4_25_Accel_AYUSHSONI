## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Escrow Program (LiteSVM)
A Solana program that implements an escrow service, allowing secure token swaps between two parties. Built using LiteSVM for local testing and development.

**Key Features:**
- Secure token escrow functionality
- Multi-signature support
- Time-locked releases
- Integration with Solana Program Library (SPL) tokens

**Tech Stack:**
- Rust
- Solana Program Framework
- Anchor Framework

### 2. Whitelist Transfer Hook
A Solana program that implements transfer hooks for whitelisted token transfers, enabling additional validation and restrictions on token transfers.

**Key Features:**
- On-chain whitelist management
- Transfer validation
- Custom transfer restrictions
- Integration with SPL Token-2022

**Tech Stack:**
- Rust
- Solana Program Framework
- SPL Token-2022
